        <h1>Gudipudi Ganesh does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h2>Uncle Vanya Anton Chekov</h2>
        <p>MARINA. [Pouring some tea into a glass] Take a little tea, my son.</p>

        <p>ASTROFF. [Takes the glass from her unwillingly] Somehow, I don't seem to
            want any.</p>
            
        <p>MARINA. Then will you have a little vodka instead?</p>
            
        <p>ASTROFF. No, I don't drink vodka every day, and besides, it is too hot
            now. [A pause] Tell me, nurse, how long have we known each other?</p>
            
        <p>MARINA. [Thoughtfully] Let me see, how long is it? Lord--help me to
            remember. You first came here, into our parts--let me think--when was
            it? Sonia's mother was still alive--it was two winters before she died;
            that was eleven years ago--[thoughtfully] perhaps more.</p>
            
        <p>ASTROFF. Have I changed much since then?</p>
            
        <p>MARINA. Oh, yes. You were handsome and young then, and now you are an
            old man and not handsome any more. You drink, too.</p>
